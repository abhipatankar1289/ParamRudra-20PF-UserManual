# PARAM Rudra — 20 PetaFlop System User Manual

![C-DAC PARAM Rudra — 20 PetaFlop Supercomputer](assets/img/home1.png){ loading=lazy }

Welcome to the user documentation for **PARAM Rudra**, a ~20 PetaFlop
HPC system operated under the **National Supercomputing Mission (NSM)** by
**C-DAC**. This guide walks you through everything from your first login to
running large-scale CPU, high-memory and GPU jobs through the SLURM batch
system.

*PARAM Rudra is implemented by C-DAC under the National Supercomputing Mission,
supported by MeitY and DST, Government of India.*{ .cobrand-caption }

!!! tip "New here? Start with these three pages"
    1. [Getting Access](access.md) — Visit the PARAM Rudra Open OnDemand (OOD) portal.
    2. [Environment](environment.md) — modules, shell and your `/home` & `/scratch` directories.
    3. [Batch System (SLURM)](batch.md) — never run compute on the login node; submit jobs instead.

## The golden rules

!!! danger "Do not run jobs on the login node"
    Running compute-heavy processes on a login node degrades service for
    everyone and **will result in your process being terminated without prior
    notice** (repeat offences may cost you account access). Always submit work
    through SLURM — see the [Batch System](batch.md) page.


!!! note
    **$HOME:** `/home/<group_name>/<user_name>/`

    **$SCRATCH:** `/scratch/<group_name>/<user_name>/`


!!! warning "`/scratch` is purged"
    As per the policy, files stored in /scratch will be retained for only one week, after which they will be permanently deleted.
    `/scratch` is fast working space, **not** long-term
    storage. Back up important results elsewhere — see [Data Management](data.md).

## Quick reference card

```bash
# Connect: Visit the PARAM Rudra Open OnDemand (OOD) portal.


# Software: Spack (primary) + modules
module load spack
. /home/apps/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
spack find                   # installed packages
spack load <pkg>             # load one
module load miniconda/26.7.0        # Python / Conda ML environments

# SLURM essentials
sinfo                        # partition / node status
squeue -u $USER              # your jobs
sbatch job.slurm             # submit a batch job
salloc ...                   # interactive allocation
scancel <jobid>              # cancel a job

# Always specify your accounting/project code
#SBATCH -A <your_account>

!!! note "About this manual"
    This is a **community/user-maintained** guide for the C-DAC PARAM Rudra
    20 PetaFlop system, grounded in the **official C-DAC PARAM Rudra User
    Manual** plus the live login banner and SLURM configuration. Where a value
    may change over time (versions, quotas, hashes), the page tells you the
    command to confirm it on the system. The authoritative source is always the
    **login banner** and the C-DAC support desk (`rudrasupport@cdac.in`).
    Corrections are welcome via
